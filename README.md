# Serilog.Enrichers.WithCaller

** how to use, code example see unit test code **

Performance of this approach is low due to Reflection and Diagnostic. However, it's helpful if you need the method Parameters and Values in your log output.

Example OutputTemplate: [{Timestamp:HH:mm:ss} {Level:u3}] {Message} (at {Caller}){NewLine}{Exception}

Since version 1.1.0 (thanks to 0xced), supports including file info in caller property
Since version 1.2.0 (thanks to Khaos66), supports adding max frame depth of stack 
Since version 1.3.0 (thanks to wexman), own output template definition possible, 
  for example
  {Timestamp:HH:mm:ss.fff} {Level:u3} [{CallerType}.{CallerMethod}({CallerParameters}) {CallerFileName}:{CallerLineNo}] {Message:lj}{NewLine}{Exception}
